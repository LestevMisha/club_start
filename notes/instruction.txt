1. - change path in .env on current domain name (path). Last line `MAIN_WEBSITE_URL`
2. - change notification link in YooKassa on a current domain name and add /yoocallback at the end
3. - set telegram webhook on the current url using /setwebhook page on the website (1st step must be done bfr it)

command: npx localtunnel --port 8000 --subdomain danielshkitov
url: https://danielshkitov.loca.lt/


brew services start httpd
brew services start mysql
php artisan serve
npx localtunnel --port 8000 --subdomain danielshkitov

open: https://misha.com:8443/
open for webhook: https://danielshkitov.loca.lt/setwebhook
open for db: mysql -u root
use laravel4; show tables; describe users; select * from users;

delete from users; delete from users_transactions; delete from users images;

Project Rules + Doc about this project for the next devs (if applicable):
1. Be sure to use https connection over SSL.
2. Errors with project transfer can occur only if .env file isn't set correctly,
make sure that it is connected to mysql db, check yookassa API keys if yookassa
integrationdoesn't work, if Symfony Sanctum error happened - install this extension with `composer install Symfony`,
if telegram registration doesn't work check that Telegram Bot API key is up to date and correct, check if you set webhook with 
https://klubstart.com/setwebhook etc (more info in routes/web.php).
3. When working with localhost be sure that you connect over https use localtunnel for example (npx localtunnel --port 8000 --subdomain danielshkitov),
then make sure to use https://danielshkitov.loca.lt/setwebhook, otherwise registration via telegram won't work, than set it back on https://klubstart.com/setwebhook
so that people can register.
4. Before you set `npx localtunnel --port 8000 --subdomain danielshkitov` you should have project running on localhost,
the usual command fot this is `php artisan serve`.
5. The reason website doesn't work on https is that in resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php I used `secure_asset` if you
want it rinning, use/replace-on just `asset` in resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php, resources/views/components/layouts/auth.blade.php,
resources/views/components/layouts/dashboard.blade.php (if applicable), resources/views/livewire/main-index.blade.php. And remove `URL::forceScheme("https");` line
from routes/web.php. If this didn't work check if you use production and change it on dev (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34378122/load-blade-assets-with-https-in-laravel).
6. When you use /setwebhook /removewebhook be sure to check for which domain name you do that in .env file! IMPORTANT!
7. YooKassa IMPORTANT! When pay set notification link on the domain you are currently working with and add /yoocallback, example https://klubstart.com/yoocallback.
8. When you integrate any changes with the schemes in db run `php artisan migrate:refresh --seed` (on hosting if applicable).
9. !IMPORTANT run `php artisan migrate:refresh --seed` when transfer on the new hosting!.

10. !IMPORTANT MAKE SURE you use callback link for the correct store!!! It ran into issues because store was the different from the API keys, so I was 
setting calback on the wrong shop.

// Hopefully this helps. (2024)
